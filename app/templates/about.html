    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        // This script enhances the user interaction on a website by managing review submissions through multiple forms. Once the page is fully loaded, it attaches event listeners to all forms designated as review forms. When a review form is submitted, the script intercepts the default submission process to prevent page reload. Instead, it collects the form data and sends it to the server using an asynchronous fetch request. The server response is then processed to determine if the submission was successful. Users are immediately informed of the outcome through an alertâ€”either confirming the successful submission of their comment or indicating a failure to submit. In case of any network errors during the submission process, the script catches these errors, logs them to the console, and alerts the user, thereby maintaining a seamless and responsive user experience. This approach significantly improves the website's interactivity, allowing users to submit reviews without interrupting their browsing experience.
        document.querySelectorAll('.review-form').forEach(form => {
            form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
